- Our data set We are looking at data from an app. The app is very simple and has just 4 pages:

- The first page is the home page. When you come to the site for the first time, you can only land on the home page as a first page. From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page. 
- From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page (paywall), where
she is asked to provide payment information in order to subscribe. 
- If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page.
